# ElectroHub - Online Electronics Shopping System

Welcome to ElectroHub, your go-to destination for a seamless online shopping experience for electronics products. This project was developed using Eclipse IDE.

## Technologies Used:

### Front-End Development:
1. **HTML:** The backbone of our user interface, ensuring a structured and accessible presentation of electronics products.
2. **CSS:** Styling elements to create an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.
3. **JavaScript:** Enhancing interactivity and responsiveness for a dynamic browsing experience.
4. **Bootstrap:** Utilizing the power of responsive design and pre-built components to streamline development.

### Back-End Development:
1. **Java [JDK 8+]:** Providing a robust and platform-independent server-side foundation for our application.
2. **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):** Enabling seamless communication between Java applications and the MySQL database.
3. **Servlet:** Handling HTTP requests and responses to build a scalable and efficient server-side architecture.
4. **JSP (JavaServer Pages):** Creating dynamic, data-driven web pages for a personalized user experience.

### Database:
- **MySQL:** Serving as the relational database management system to store and retrieve data efficiently. Singleton pattern is applied to manage database access, ensuring a single point of control for connection management.

## Design Patterns:

### Singleton Pattern:
Applying the Singleton pattern to the Database, we ensure a single instance for database access, promoting efficient resource management and a centralized control mechanism.

### Factory Pattern:
Implementing the Factory pattern to manage services, we encapsulate the instantiation process, promoting flexibility and consistency in the creation of various components within the system.

### Strategy Pattern:
Leveraging the Strategy pattern to manage electronics products, we define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This dynamic approach allows for flexible product management based on specific requirements.

## How to Use:

To deploy and run ElectroHub locally using Eclipse IDE, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open Eclipse IDE and import the project.
3. Set up the MySQL database and configure the connection properties.
4. Run the application, and access ElectroHub through your preferred web browser.

Feel free to explore and customize the codebase to meet your specific needs. We welcome contributions and feedback to enhance the functionality and user experience of ElectroHub.

Happy shopping!
